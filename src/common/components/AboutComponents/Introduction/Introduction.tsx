      <IntroductionDescription>
        I was born in Henderson, Nevada almost three decades ago. From an early
        age I showed interest for computers and that grew into a passion during
        high school. I got into web design and development in college. Attending
        the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh was the best decision I
        ever made because it showed me what I wanted to do for the rest of my
        life. Currently I help businesses all around the world by designing and
        coding websites and mobile apps. I had the pleasure of working with big
        companies like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, just to name a few. Right
        now Iâ€™m based in New York.
